## Overview

This project is a smart contract that allows:

1) Distributing royalties to NFT owners of a collection (Mints, Secondary Sales, Licensing Payments)
e.g. a percentage of a mint value is distributed to all NFT owners proportionally
2) Owners can withdraw owed royalty balances
3) Membership is verifiable by referencing the custom ledger containing the NFTs
